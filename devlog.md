Still working on vulkan bare-bones. Have mostly been trying to figure out the Vulkan lifecycle, how it interacts with the GPU, and what the crap they're talking about...  It was a bit confusing, but I understand most of it now. Enough for the bare-bones project.

We'll refactor later anyway, so optimized engine code can wait until then. In which case, the Vulkan bare-bones should be finished in 2 days; There's quite a lot to do.  

After that is probably a quick software design refactor, and then a scene-builder abstraction.
