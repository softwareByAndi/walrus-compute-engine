# walrus compute engine

this engine is still in progress.  
See `devlog.md` for project status.  
See `todo.md` for current task breakdown.  

This is iteration 3 of a vulkan compute & graphics engine. This iteration is intended to improve the overall structure of the project, as well as introduce more flexibility for the programmer.

An API has not yet been developed, but will be when the MVP is complete.
