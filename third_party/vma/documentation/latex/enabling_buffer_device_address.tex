Device extension VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+buffer\+\_\+device\+\_\+address allow to fetch raw GPU pointer to a buffer and pass it for usage in a shader code. It is promoted to core Vulkan 1.\+2.

If you want to use this feature in connection with VMA, follow these steps\+:\hypertarget{enabling_buffer_device_address_enabling_buffer_device_address_initialization}{}\doxysection{Initialization}\label{enabling_buffer_device_address_enabling_buffer_device_address_initialization}
1) (For Vulkan version $<$ 1.\+2) Call {\ttfamily vk\+Enumerate\+Device\+Extension\+Properties} for the physical device. Check if the extension is supported -\/ if returned array of {\ttfamily Vk\+Extension\+Properties} contains \char`\"{}\+VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+buffer\+\_\+device\+\_\+address\char`\"{}.

2) Call {\ttfamily vk\+Get\+Physical\+Device\+Features2} for the physical device instead of old {\ttfamily vk\+Get\+Physical\+Device\+Features}. Attach additional structure {\ttfamily Vk\+Physical\+Device\+Buffer\+Device\+Address\+Features$\ast$} to {\ttfamily Vk\+Physical\+Device\+Features2\+::p\+Next} to be returned. Check if the device feature is really supported -\/ check if {\ttfamily Vk\+Physical\+Device\+Buffer\+Device\+Address\+Features$\ast$\+::buffer\+Device\+Address} is true.

3) (For Vulkan version $<$ 1.\+2) While creating device with {\ttfamily vk\+Create\+Device}, enable this extension -\/ add \char`\"{}\+VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+buffer\+\_\+device\+\_\+address\char`\"{} to the list passed as {\ttfamily Vk\+Device\+Create\+Info\+::pp\+Enabled\+Extension\+Names}.

4) While creating the device, also don\textquotesingle{}t set {\ttfamily Vk\+Device\+Create\+Info\+::p\+Enabled\+Features}. Fill in {\ttfamily Vk\+Physical\+Device\+Features2} structure instead and pass it as {\ttfamily Vk\+Device\+Create\+Info\+::p\+Next}. Enable this device feature -\/ attach additional structure {\ttfamily Vk\+Physical\+Device\+Buffer\+Device\+Address\+Features$\ast$} to {\ttfamily Vk\+Physical\+Device\+Features2\+::p\+Next} and set its member {\ttfamily buffer\+Device\+Address} to {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+TRUE}.

5) While creating \mbox{\hyperlink{structVmaAllocator}{Vma\+Allocator}} with vma\+Create\+Allocator() inform VMA that you have enabled this feature -\/ add \#\+VMA\+\_\+\+ALLOCATOR\+\_\+\+CREATE\+\_\+\+BUFFER\+\_\+\+DEVICE\+\_\+\+ADDRESS\+\_\+\+BIT to \mbox{\hyperlink{structVmaAllocatorCreateInfo_a392ea2ecbaff93f91a7c49f735ad4346}{Vma\+Allocator\+Create\+Info\+::flags}}.\hypertarget{enabling_buffer_device_address_enabling_buffer_device_address_usage}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{enabling_buffer_device_address_enabling_buffer_device_address_usage}
After following steps described above, you can create buffers with {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+BUFFER\+\_\+\+USAGE\+\_\+\+SHADER\+\_\+\+DEVICE\+\_\+\+ADDRESS\+\_\+\+BIT$\ast$} using VMA. The library automatically adds {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+MEMORY\+\_\+\+ALLOCATE\+\_\+\+DEVICE\+\_\+\+ADDRESS\+\_\+\+BIT$\ast$} to allocated memory blocks wherever it might be needed.

Please note that the library supports only {\ttfamily VK\+\_\+\+BUFFER\+\_\+\+USAGE\+\_\+\+SHADER\+\_\+\+DEVICE\+\_\+\+ADDRESS\+\_\+\+BIT$\ast$}. The second part of this functionality related to \char`\"{}capture and replay\char`\"{} is not supported, as it is intended for usage in debugging tools like Render\+Doc, not in everyday Vulkan usage.\hypertarget{enabling_buffer_device_address_enabling_buffer_device_address_more_information}{}\doxysection{More information}\label{enabling_buffer_device_address_enabling_buffer_device_address_more_information}
