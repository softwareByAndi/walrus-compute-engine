VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+dedicated\+\_\+allocation is a Vulkan extension which can be used to improve performance on some GPUs. It augments Vulkan API with possibility to query driver whether it prefers particular buffer or image to have its own, dedicated allocation (separate {\ttfamily Vk\+Device\+Memory} block) for better efficiency -\/ to be able to do some internal optimizations.

The extension is supported by this library. It will be used automatically when enabled. To enable it\+:

1 . When creating Vulkan device, check if following 2 device extensions are supported (call {\ttfamily vk\+Enumerate\+Device\+Extension\+Properties()}). If yes, enable them (fill {\ttfamily Vk\+Device\+Create\+Info\+::pp\+Enabled\+Extension\+Names}).


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+get\+\_\+memory\+\_\+requirements2
\item VK\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+dedicated\+\_\+allocation
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you enabled these extensions\+:

2 . Use \#\+VMA\+\_\+\+ALLOCATOR\+\_\+\+CREATE\+\_\+\+KHR\+\_\+\+DEDICATED\+\_\+\+ALLOCATION\+\_\+\+BIT flag when creating your \mbox{\hyperlink{structVmaAllocator}{Vma\+Allocator}}\`{}to inform the library that you enabled required extensions and you want the library to use them.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{allocatorInfo.flags |= VMA\_ALLOCATOR\_CREATE\_KHR\_DEDICATED\_ALLOCATION\_BIT;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{vmaCreateAllocator(\&allocatorInfo, \&allocator);}

\end{DoxyCode}


That\textquotesingle{}s all. The extension will be automatically used whenever you create a buffer using vma\+Create\+Buffer() or image using vma\+Create\+Image().

When using the extension together with Vulkan Validation Layer, you will receive warnings like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}vkBindBufferMemory(): Binding memory to buffer 0x33 but vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements() has not been called on that buffer.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 It is OK, you should just ignore it. It happens because you use function {\ttfamily vk\+Get\+Buffer\+Memory\+Requirements2\+KHR()} instead of standard {\ttfamily vk\+Get\+Buffer\+Memory\+Requirements()}, while the validation layer seems to be unaware of it.
