# Renderpasses

### all rendering happens inside a `VkRenderPass`

In Vulkan, all rendering happens inside a `VkRenderPass`. It is not possible to do rendering commands outside a renderpass, but it is possible to do Compute commands without them.

A `VkRenderPass` is a Vulkan object that `encapsulates the state` needed to set up the “target” for rendering, and the `state of the images` you will be rendering to.

The renderpass is a concept that only exists in Vulkan. It’s there because `it allows the driver to know more about the state of the images you render`.

A Renderpass will render into a `Framebuffer`. The framebuffer `links` to the images you will render to, and it’s used when starting a renderpass to set the target images for rendering.

## The general use of a renderpass when encoding commands is like this:

```C++
vkBeginCommandBuffer(cmd, ...);

vkCmdBeginRenderPass(cmd, ...);

//rendering commands go here

vkCmdEndRenderPass(cmd);

vkEndCommandBuffer(cmd)
```

When beginning a renderpass, you set the target framebuffer, and the clear color (if available). In this first chapter, we will change the clear color dynamically over time.

## Subpasses
A renderpass also contains `subpasses`, which are a bit like the `rendering “steps”`. They can be very useful in mobile GPUs, as they allow the driver to `optimize` things quite a lot. In desktop GPUs, they are less important, so we aren’t going to use them. When creating the renderpass, it will only have 1 subpass which is the minimum required for rendering.

## Image Layouts
A very important thing that the renderpass does, is that it performs image layout changes when entering and exiting the renderpass.

`Images` in the GPU aren’t necessarily in the format you would expect. For optimization purposes, the GPUs perform a lot of transformation and reshuffling of them into internal opaque formats. For example, some GPUs will compress textures whenever they can, and will reorder the way the pixels are arranged so that they mipmap better. In Vulkan, you don’t have control of that, but there is control over the layout for the image, which lets the driver transform the image to those optimized internal formats.

In this first chapter, we are only going to use a few image layouts

- `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED` : Don’t care of what the layout is, can be whatever.
- `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` : Image is on a layout optimal to be written into by rendering commands.
- `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR` : Image is on a layout that allows displaying the image on the screen.
- `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` : (Used later) Image is on a format optimized to be read from shaders.
